To work with project you should have python 3.6+ installed

To start using API you need to:
1) download the project
2) unzip files to /home/user_name/API/
3) connect project to IDE and create virtual environment (File - Settings - select project - Project Interpreter - Add)
4) run pip3 install -r requirements.txt  (if pip3 not installed -> install in on terminal)
5) try to run "python main3.py" on terminal (install the needed packages if the errors occurred)
6) executed command will looks like https://i.imgur.com/6IP4aG0.png
7) then you can create and send your requests

The API runs at localhost:8888/api/api_name
for all authorizations use the data from data.txt file

GET authorization:
<url>/?auth=username:password

POST authorization:
the same as GET, but in request body
key = auth
value = username:password

HTTP auth
you need to add basic authentication with credentials from the data.txt file

GET /api/show - Show all data from data.txt. Requires GET and header (http auth) authorization.
POST /api/add  - Add an entry (a user) to data.txt. Requires POST and header (http auth) authorization.
POST /api/delete - Delete an entry (a user) from data.txt. Requires POST, GET and header (http auth) authorization.
